        Dummy Text -
        The greeting text on the welcome screen is your first opportunity to tell a person why they should start a conversation with your Messenger bot.
        Some things you might include in your greeting text might include a brief description of what your bot does, such as key features, or a tag line.
        This is also a great place to start establishing the style and tone of your bot.
        The welcome screen is the first thing people see when they encounter your Messenger bot,and includes information that allows a person to learn about your bot and what it offers.
        The welcome screen displays the name and responsiveness of your bot,the profile picture and cover photo from your Facebook Page, an optional greeting message, and the get started button.
