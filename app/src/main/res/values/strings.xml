    <string name="test_body">
        The problem with this is that on background threads,
        having an open Realm instance that you don’t close even when the thread execution is over is very costly,
        and can cause strange errors. As such,
        it’s recommended to close the Realm on your background thread when the execution is done in a finally block.
        This includes IntentServices.
